How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function
min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Always keep track of the minimum value in a field (inside Node structure or object) when pushing onto the stack. This
way the head will always know of its local minimum.
